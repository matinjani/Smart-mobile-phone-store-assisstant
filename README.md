📝 Overview

The Smart Mobile Phone Store Assistant is a simple Python-based application that helps manage a small electronics shop. It simulates basic store operations such as:

Viewing available products

Adding or updating items in the inventory

Purchasing items and updating stock

Generating a final bill for customers

It’s designed as a menu-driven program that runs in the terminal, making it lightweight and easy to use.

📦 Features

Product Catalog: Preloaded with mobiles, laptops, and tablets (with price and stock).

View Products: Displays current stock with alerts for low availability.

Add Products: Add new items or update existing ones dynamically.

Purchase Flow: Customers can add items to a cart, check stock availability, and confirm purchases.

Billing System: Generates a detailed bill with total cost.

🚀 How It Works

Run the script in Python.

From the Main Menu, choose one of the following options:

1 → View products

2 → Add or update products

3 → Purchase items

4 → Exit the application

If purchasing, the system checks stock and calculates the bill.

Inventory is automatically updated after each purchase.

💡 Example Workflow

Views available mobiles, laptops, and tablets.

Adds a new product (e.g., “Smartwatch”).

Purchases 2 mobiles.

Receives a printed bill and updated stock levels.
